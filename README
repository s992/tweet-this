This plugin is very much in ALPHA. I take no responsibility for your drunken tweets or 
any other catastrophic failures.

INSTALLATION:
==========
1. Deploy as you would a normal plugin, assign to a site(the plugin does not currently
   support multi-site installs).
2. Go to your plugin manager and open up the plugin admin page.
3. Click the authorize link so that the plugin can store your oAuth details from Twitter.
4. Tweet away!

OTHER NOTES:
==========
This is not currently set up to post Tweets from anything other than "Page/Default" type
pages. Eventually this will be a setting, but not tonight.

Please report any bugs via the GitHub repository(https://github.com/s992/tweet-this).
Feel free to submit as many pull requests as you want, all criticism is welcome.
