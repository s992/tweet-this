INSTALLATION:
==========
1. Deploy as you would a normal plugin, assign to a site(the plugin is not currently
   tested for multi-site installs).
2. You'll need to enter a caret delimited list of content types you would like to be able
   to Tweet from. The list is pre-populated with Mura's standard content types.
3. Go to your plugin manager and open up the plugin admin page.
4. Click the authorize link so that the plugin can store your oAuth details from Twitter.
5. Tweet away! You'll find the Tweet Box towards the bottom of each default type(i.e. "Page/Default").
